### Micronations are defined as nations unrecognized by major world powers, and are often enclosed by other, larger nations.

These nations are usually no bigger than a small town, and can be as tiny as a single home. Their population is rarely greater than 50, although micronations still have rich histories with dictatorships, presidents, rebellions, and more.
